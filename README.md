# AgriChatBot 🌱🤖

## Project Overview
**AgriChatBot** is a Python web application designed to empower farmers by providing quick and reliable agricultural information. It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** to answer farmers' queries. The model retrieves relevant information from a collection of agricultural websites and PDF documents, then generates precise and comprehensive answers tailored to each user's question.

This project is a personalized version of AgriGenius, enhanced for better usability and clarity.
